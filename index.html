                                <h2>Authentication Security</h2>
                                <p>Many IoT devices are manufactured with poor authentication methods. Often, they will use the same password for each device. These default login credentials used are often easy to find online. While this could be useful if you forget your login details, hackers may find this information even more useful. Hackers have been known to make use of default login credentials to take control over IoT devices, which are then used as part of a botnet.</p>

<h3>How can you prevent this?</h3>
Devices should come with some way of changing the login details or at the very least, a way of changing the password. This should be done when initially setting up the device. If the device has an application, often there will be an option in the settings to change the password. Sometimes the device may require connecting via the internet using a web browser.</p>

<h3>Choosing a password</h3>
<p>It is considered good practice to use a combination of two or more lowercase, uppercase, numbers or special characters. For example: P@ssw0rd. However, the example given would be a poor example of a password, ‘P@ssw0rd’ is the fifth most guessed password used by hackers. This is because the word ‘password’ itself and any derivatives which replace letters with numbers, symbols or capitals are usually contained in password lists, which hackers would utilise when carrying out brute force attacks.</br> 
Words that are contained in dictionaries are generally considered as being bad to use in passwords as they are likely to be easier to guess than a random combination of letters, numbers and symbols. However, a password that is a random combination of letters, numbers and symbols is difficult to remember.</br>
The best advice is to use a combination of words that you will remember, such as, song lyrics, a phrase or sentence from your favourite book, whilst ensuring that it also contains numbers and special characters.</br>
One of the most effective methods for ensuring that strong passwords are used, is to use a password manager. Password managers are capable of generating long, unique passwords that contain a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. They store login details for multiple locations, so you only need to remember one password.</p>

<h3>Brute Force Mitigation</h3>
<p>For many IoT devices it may be difficult to implement account lockout controls which limit the amount of failed login attempts that are allowed. Using a strong password helps to mitigate against brute force attacks, as a strong password lengthens the time it would take for a hacker to be successful with this method.</br>
Some devices will require remote access, often via SSH. SSH is often a target service by hackers, using brute force attacks to try gain access. When using SSH it is important to ensure that the most up to date version is being used. If it is possible to implement, key-based authentication should be set up and password based login should be disabled.</br>
Firewall rules for SSH or any other service that allows remote access should be updated to only accept input from the LAN or from a specific IP address that requires access.</br>
Changing the port that SSH runs on may prevent certain attacks that scan and try to connect to SSH’s default port 22, this does not prevent attackers from discovering SSH on a different port.

                                <h3> Data Storage and Communications</h3>
                                <p>When data, which may include personal data, is transferred from one location to another, it should always be encrypted. If data is transferred in plain-text without any encryption, it is possible that a hacker can intercept the data, in what is known as a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).</p>

<p>If your device has settings,  it is advisable to activate or use HTTPS rather than using HTTP. If sensitive data is collected by the device it is important to ensure it has an effective form of cryptography. Any insecure, unencrypted methods of communication, such as telnet, should be disabled. </br>

Not only is it important to ensure any sensitive or personal data is encrypted whilst being transmitted, any data that is stored should be encrypted and stored securely. If the device isn’t supplied with instructions for implementing encryption, it may be worth visiting the manufacturer’s website.</br>

                                </p>

                                <h3>Ensuring Software and Firmware are up to Date</h3>
                                <p>Over time bugs are usually found in software or firmware. These bugs may affect the usability or performance of the software, and are often identified as being vulnerable areas that could be utilised by hackers.
                                    Some companies will patch or fix the bugs discovered to ensure they function properly and/or to remove any security vulnerabilities. It is therefore important to update any software or firmware, as hackers may try to exploit any vulnerabilities.
                                    
                                    <h3>How to Update</h3>
                                    Sometimes it is possible to update the firmware of IoT devices via an app or through their website user interface. If there are no clear options to update the software or firmware of an IoT device on its app or website, then it may be worth looking on the manufacturers website for instructions on how to carry this out.
